### The 'game' so far currently only allows you to only look at a script-generated map and click around. However, more features plan to be added.

## It's not a bug, it's a feature... I swear!
### There are no bugs at the moment. (surprisingly)

## Upcoming features
### Working on disease.js (Spreading & creation of disease)
### Nothing else at the moment.
